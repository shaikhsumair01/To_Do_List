**To Do list "Readme" file
This file is created using react (vite) and tailwind. It is a simple to do list app where the user can add, update, mark and delete the tasks created by them.

To run the file first download the repo as it is from the github and unpack it. In the VS code or any other code editor open the folder (TO_DO_APP) since it's the main git directory and 
type "cd ToDo_list" in the terminal to get the project/working directory (vite directory). 

Then run the command "npm install" to get the node module folder. 
Then use "npm run dev" to run the project.
